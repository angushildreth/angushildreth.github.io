        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Welcome to our research lab!</p>
        <p>We are a social psychology research lab based at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.  We are a group of undergraduate students and a graduate student who work on organizational research for a number of faculty at Haas and at other US business schools.</p>
        <p>Our research focuses on two main areas:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the social psychology of power and status in organizational contexts. Particularly, we seek to understand the effects of power and status on leaders, on their interactions with their peers in top teams, and on the cultures they create in their organizations.</li>
          <li>the effects of loyalty on ethical decision making and trust. I.e., we seek to understand how loyalty gives rise to expectations that affect decision making and ethical behavior.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our lab fosters a learning environment in which our undergraduate researchers are expected to continue to learn though-out their time in the lab and to get involved in all aspects of the research process. <a href="#labValues">[See Values]</a></p>

        <p>Since 2009, more than 50 undergraduate researchers have been part of the lab and the first few cohorts are now graduating and going onto successful careers in the corporate, medical and academic arenas.</p>

        <h3>How to apply</h3>
        <p>We hire new researchers every semester through the Berkeley Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) link. Our research lab is listed under Professor Cameron Anderson at the Haas School - "Leadership in Unusual Contexts."   </p>
        <p>We usually recruit a couple of new Research Apprentices each semester to join our research lab. We look for motivated, hard-working researchers who will bring a variety of different experiences and insights to our lab. We particularly value diversity: current researchers are majoring in business, economics, psychology, molecular biology, computer science, math, statistics and political science. Past alumni from our lab have gone on to graduate schools (MS, JD, MD, PhD), to work in finance (investment banking, accounting, consulting), and to work in the public and non-profit sectors (US government, the Red Cross).</p>
        <p>  Our goal is to have students participate in as much of the research process as possible. Research Apprentices work on a variety of different research projects with a number of faculty and PhD students at Haas (and at other universities). Current projects relate to issues of power, status, close relationships, gratitude, ethics and conflict.</p>
        <p>  Over the course of the semester Research Assistants will receive regular training on standard statistical tools including basic statistical software used in research analysis as well as survey and excel which have proved useful skills in subsequent internships and employment.</p>
        <p>  Over the longer-term, many research apprentices stay on in the lab. We expect researchers to continue to learn and develop throughout their tenure in the lab: to become competent with technical and qualitative research skills, with communication and teamwork skills, and to take increasing responsibility for research projects, ultimately assuming leadership roles and reporting directly to faculty.</p>
        <p>We run regular training on the research process, excel for beginners, intermediate, and vba, Managing Data, Qualtrics, Mechanical Turk, and SPSS.</p>

            <h3>Melisa Bintoro</h3>
            <p>Melisa is a senior research associate at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab in Jakarta, Indonesia working on a project on international migration. Since graduating UC Berkeley in 2012 with a dual degree in Business Administration and Political Science, she attended the University of Cambridge for the MPhil in Development Studies (Distinction). She is also planning to pursue her PhD next year. Melisa was a member of the research lab for 3 years before graduating in Spring 2012. During her time in the lab, Melisa did research with Professors Tetlock, Bazerman, and Anderson.</p>
            <p>The research lab gave me a first-hand account of how social psychology research is conducted in a world-class university. I was exposed to every step of the research process from drafting funding proposals to running laboratory experiments to analysing data, which was extremely beneficial as I conducted my own research at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. While my academic research is in political economy, I have often applied the methodology I learned in lab to my projects. Furthermore, the leadership and teamwork skills that I have gained from this experience have helped me in both the private and public sectors.</p>

            <h3>Erika Oblea</h3>
            <p>Erika Oblea is in her second year at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C.  After graduating from UC Berkeley in 2011 with degrees in Statistics and Political Science, she worked as a research assistant at a public policy research firm in Washington, D.C.  In that position, she helped implement experimental research that would measure the benefits of transitional employment programs on low-income individuals.  Erika was a member of the research lab for two years, beginning in Spring 2010.  During her time in the lab, Erika did research on the effects of XXX on YYY with Professor Bazerman and Professor Gino as well as research on the relationship between groups and power with Professor Anderson.</p>
            <p>Erika believes she would never have gotten her research position after graduation had she not worked at the research lab. Working at the lab exposed her to the mechanics of performing experimental research, gave her the skills necessary to organize and analyze large amounts of data, and provided her the tools to perform effective literature review—all skills she utilized as a research assistant after graduation.  However, what Erika values most was the opportunity to be part of a team where her opinions were valued and considered in the design and implementation of the experiments.</p>

            <h3>Eric Anderson</h3>
            <p>Eric Andersen currently works as an investment banking analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York.  An economics major who graduated from UC Berkeley in 2013, Eric spent 2.5 years working with Angus on research projects that explore the dynamics of social power, working in group settings, and market inefficiencies.  In addition to conducting experiments, implementing new protocols, and facilitating the creation and processing of grant proposals, Eric also worked to develop new research designs to test hypotheses in an IRB and CPHS-compliant framework. Dr. Cameron Anderson, Dr. Don Moore, and Dr. Leif Nelson sponsored the projects on which Eric assisted.</p>
            <p>Eric credits his time on the research team as one of the most formative experiences he enjoyed at Cal. Being fully immersed into all stages of the research process throughout all stages of a project provided him an opportunity to put classroom-taught theory into practice.  For Eric, research is an education that can't be realized by simply earning a degree.  The journey from hypothesis to theory is long; translating an untested thought into an academically-rigorous, empirically-supported rationale requires a researcher to rely on all the tools at his or her disposal: classroom theory, statistics and econometrics, and personal maturity and interest.  For those new to Cal or to research, a desire to learn about research, theory, or both is the only prerequisite to joining the team.  To do so as a part of Angus' team is an excellent opportunity to receive hands on training and practice developing analytical skills in an open, safe, friendly, and communicative environment where differing opinions are welcomed and every member of the team makes a substantive impact.</p>

            <h3>Kapil Gururangan</h3>
            <p>Kapil is a research assistant at the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Laboratory of Professor Robert Knight in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. Kapil graduated from UC Berkeley in 2013 with a double major in Molecular & Cell Biology (Honors in Neurobiology) and Business Administration. He is planning to attend medical school to pursue a career in clinical research and patient care as a neurologist.</p>
            <p>Kapil joined the research team in his sophomore year and worked under professors at the Haas School of Business (Anderson, Chatman, Nelson, Moore) and the Harvard Business School (Bazerman, Gino) until his graduation. He was primarily involved in Professor Cameron Anderson's research on the role of power in interpersonal contexts, and over the three years, he also contributed to research on voice, XXX, social status and organizational culture. During his senior year, Kapil took on the role of lab manager, which involved coordinating lab activities, writing proposals for grants, getting more involved in research theory and logistics, and working closer with professors and administrators.</p>
            <p>This experience was integral to Kapil's personal and professional development. The extensive exposure to all aspects of the research process – such as data analysis, lab logistics and administration, literature review and scientific writing – made the research environment that much more formative in his scientific training. His training in social psychology gave him an appreciation for the subtleties of psychosocial variables that come into play in clinical and public health research. The technical and interpersonal skills contributed significantly to Kapil receiving the I.L. Chaikoff Award in neurobiology for his honors thesis, which included results from an experiment that Kapil proposed, designed, and analyzed through our lab. One year of lab management experience was also far above what undergraduates could expect from a research position. This led to his employment as a graduate student instructor for an MBA course titled "Power and Politics in Organizations" that leveraged the research background and professional maturity he achieved as a lab manager. His tenure in the lab provided a unique opportunity for Kapil to develop vital leadership skills and a deeper appreciation for research that he is eager to bring to bear while he grows as a physician.</p>
