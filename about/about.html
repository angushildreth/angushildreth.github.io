      <h3>About Angus</h3>
      <p>Angus Hildreth is a doctoral candidate in the Management of Organizations group at the University of California, Berkeley - Walter A. Haas School of Business. His research focuses on the effects of power and status on leadership effectiveness and on the ethical consequences of loyalty in group contexts.</p>
      <p>Angus graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Master’s degree in mathematics. He is a Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK and spent a decade working as a consulting actuary for Aon and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
      <h3>Aon</h3>

At PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, he worked for five years as a consulting actuary and project manager in the Assurance, Tax, Global Human Resource Services, and Transactions Services business units managing global teams of actuaries and consultants while advising FTSE /Fortune 100 clients and private equity firms on year-end reporting, business strategy and mergers and acquisitions.</p>

He oversaw the internal communications; the crafting and execution of the strategic agenda for the firm’s three highest decision making bodies. He was responsible for the business programs for PwC’s Annual Global Leadership Summits (the annual networking and strategy conference for its 200 most senior executives) and for driving the “Agenda for the Future,” a once in a decade strategic review of PwC’s short-term execution, medium-term positioning and longer-term sustainability priorities which determined the future structure of the global organization, multi-billion dollar spend on communication and work platforms, and the desired culture for PwC’s 150 network firms.</p>
      <h3>More</h3>
