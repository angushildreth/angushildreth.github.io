        <h1>The Lab</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>We are a social psychology research lab based at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. We conduct research relating to social psychology and organizational behavior with the aim of discovering new insights that can be published in top research journals.  In particular, our research focuses on the social psychology of power and the moral psychology of XXXX.</p>
        <p>Our lab comprises undergraduate researchers and a graduate student at Haas who work with faculty both at Haas and at other US business schools.  Our lab fosters a learning environment in which our undergraduate researchers are expected to continue to learn though-out their time in the lab and to get involved in all aspects of the research process.</p>
        <p>Since 2009, more than 50 undergraduate researchers have been part of the lab and the first couple of cohorts are now graduating and going onto successful careers in the corporate, medical and academic spheres.</p>

          We hire new researchers every semester through the Berkeley Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) link.  Our research lab is listed under Professor Cameron Anderson at the Haas School - “Leadership in Unusual Contexts.”
<BR><BR>
We usually recruit a couple of new Research Apprentices each semester to join our research lab.  We look for motivated, hard-working researchers who will bring a variety of different experiences and insights to our lab.  We particularly value diversity: current researchers are majoring in business, economics, psychology, molecular biology, computer science, math, statistics and political science. Past alumni from our lab have gone on to graduate schools (MS, JD, MD, PhD) or work in finance (investment banking, accounting, consulting), or non-profit (government, the Red Cross).
<BR><BR>
Our goal is to have students participate in as much of the research process as possible.  Research Apprentices work on a variety of different research projects with a number of faculty and PhD students at Haas (and at other universities).  Current projects include power, status, close relationships, gratitude, ethics and conflict.
<BR><BR>
Over the course of the semester Research Assistants will receive regular training on standard statistical tools including basic statistical software used in research analysis as well as survey and excel which have proved useful skills in subsequent internships and employment.
<BR><BR>
Over the longer-term, many research apprentices stay on in the lab.  We expect researchers to continue to learn and develop throughout their tenure in the lab: to become competent with technical and qualitative research skills, with communication and teamwork skills, and to take increasing responsibility for research projects, ultimately assuming leadership roles and reporting directly to faculty.

    <div class="mainbody container" id="about" valign="top">
      <div id="aboutAngus">
        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Angus Hildreth</h2>
        <p>I am a doctoral candidate in the Management of Organizations group at the UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. As a PhD student, my research identity has evolved into two broad areas of interest: (1) the social psychology of hierarchy, status and power, particularly the behavior, functioning and effectiveness of top teams, and (2) the moral psychology of XXXX and ethical decision making.<p>

        <h3>Business background</h3>
        <p> After graduating from the University of Cambridge with a Masters degree in Mathematics, I spent a decade in the corporate world, living and working in two countries for two companies and in five business units: three years as a consultant and trainee actuary at Aon’s consulting division in London writing valuation programs and business models and assessing the adequacy of company insurance arrangements,  Five years at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London as a consultant, actuary and project manager in audit support, HR consulting, and transactions services business units managing global teams of up to 50 people and advising FTSE 100 clients and private equity firms on year-end reporting, business strategy and mergers and acquisitions.</p>

        <p>After completing PwC’s pilot young leadership program (the top 5% of UK managers) in 2004, I was hired to work for PwC’s global CEO (the chief executive of a 150,000 people, $25bn global organization) in New York for two years.  My role involved managing the strategic agenda and internal communications of the global CEO and PwC’s three highest decision making bodies (the global leadership, global functional management, and network strategy teams); leading the business program for PwC’s  Annual Global Leadership Summit for its 200 most powerful executives; and driving the “Agenda for the Future,” a once in a decade strategic review of PwC’s short-term execution, medium-term positioning and longer-term sustainability priorities, which determined the future structure of the global organization, as well as multi-billion dollar spend on communication and work platforms, and the future culture for PwC’s 150 network firms.</p>

        <h3>Academic career</h3>
        <p>It took me a little longer than most to realize that academia, and particularly social psychology was the path for me. As a freshly minted Cambridge mathematician joining an actuarial consulting firm in the 1990s, I was very much the quant-geek who saw the world’s problems as numbers and equations to be solved.  Over a decade later, I came to the realization that numbers don’t mean a whole hell of a lot unless people actually use them and persuading people to do just that is a lot harder than QED.</p>
        <p>My interest in the ethics of XXXX stemmed from an argument I had with Max Bazerman when he visited Berkeley. Our moral philosophies over certain ethical decisions I’d made in the business world clashed but rather than fall out we started research together to discover more…</p>
        <p>My fascination with the functioning and behavior of top teams stems from my career in the corporate world and particularly my last informative years working with executives. Admittedly I was a tad naïve when I moved to New York to start my job in the CEO’s office:  I expected to experience quintessence of effective leadership but soon discovered that behavior in the board room was far from that platonic ideal.  During my tenure with PwC’s top teams, I became a quasi-experimental psychologist, manipulating the information flow and format of executive meetings in an effort to improve meetings and get decisions made.  If only I’d collected the data!</p>
        <p>Ultimately, my experiences working day-to-day with PwC’s executives and these global leadership teams, led me to business school, where during my MBA at Berkeley I met Adam Galinsky who introduced me to business ethics, Phil Tetlock who introduced me to research and inspired me to pursue an academic career, and Cameron Anderson who saw the potential of my research ideas and has invested greatly in them ever since.</p>
        <p>I’ve never looked back.</p>
