    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My research focuses on the effects that leadership and loyalty have on relationships and behavior in organizational contexts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the area of leadership, power and status (i.e., the vertical axis of the interpersonal circumplex) I build on the experiences and insights I gained working with powerful executives in the corporate world. I investigate:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The effect that power has on leaders, on their interactions with each other and on their performance in top teams, <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
        <li>The effect that leaders’ power and influence styles have on the cultures they create in their organizations, <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
        <li>The effect that status has more broadly on an individual’s psychological well-being. <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>In the area of loyalty (i.e., the horizontal axis of the interpersonal circumplex) I build on the insights of moral psychology to investigate:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The effects that loyalty has on individual ethical behavior <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
        <li>The expectations that loyalty gives rise to including and their effects of thoughts, feelings and behavior.  E.g., expectations trust and trustworthiness, <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>My research is biased towards measuring actual behavior. I use both laboratory experiments to infer causality and field studies to demonstrate the generalizability of the effects I find in real-world contexts.</p>

    <p>I also love to collaborate with other inspiring researchers on one-off exciting projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With Professors Will Self, Barb Mellers, Greg Mitchell and Phillip Tetlock, we investigated the effects of voice on shared circumstances <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
      <li>With Professors Don Moore and Steve Blader, we investigated how accountability affects implicit biases <a href="#">[Link]</a></li>
    </ul>
